# Project status

Last reconstructed from the development log, hardware telemetry, and local
artifacts: 2026-09-03.

## Target

- Device: HiBy RS2
- Firmware: 1.4
- Player executable: MIPS32r2 ELF
- Original 1.4 `hiby_player` size: 7,133,528 bytes
- Original 1.4 SHA-256: `0fedb30f91937eafb5baaf3c75422cdbde04a62fe8bac8eca3c7a88bb761da0e`

Firmware 1.3 was used during the initial sorting work. All subsequent reverse
engineering and hardware validation moved to firmware 1.4.

## Confirmed milestones

### 1. Sorting fix

Artifact used during testing: `hiby_player_1.4_sortfix`

SHA-256:

```text
91d9e4a5d041512d26724953efbb3903f47c10b1c7a7e970bf160770254a7b8a
```

The original executable contains 14 occurrences of `COLLATE pinyin` and 18 of
`collate pinyin`. Replacing those 32 clauses with spaces changes 416 bytes,
does not change the ELF size, and restores the expected mixed-script folder
ordering.

### 2. Full folder traversal

Artifact used during testing: `hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_prev_lastchild_test`

SHA-256:

```text
d2849a8c45ce378d3ad2b2b7cf163e6fcb22d5b1670b5c5e528557945519905c
```

Confirmed behavior:

```text
Next/autoplay: 01_Flat -> Album1 -> Album2 -> 03_Flat
Previous:      03_Flat -> Album2 -> Album1 -> 01_Flat
```

The underlying defects were a comparison of local SQLite `rowid` values from
different parent lists, disabled recursive descent in the reverse direction,
and selection of the first rather than last child when entering a subtree in
reverse.

### 3. Wake refresh

Artifact used during testing:
`hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_fullnav_bkl3_force_refresh_test`

SHA-256:

```text
c825a72e1078999f74822846d35c99971f9a660addd5f12d42d50a75f0b9b80e
```

Confirmed scenario:

```text
Track A playing
-> screen off
-> automatic transition to Track B
-> Pause while the screen is off
-> screen on
-> Track B, its current time, and its progress bar are immediately displayed
```

Runtime diagnostics established that `BKL_5` is the screen-off path and
`BKL_3` is the screen-on path on this device. The successful patch performs a
metadata refresh and calls the stock progress refresh with `force=1` from the
actual `BKL_3` path.

## Latest hardware test: follow the current track folder

Latest artifact:
`hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_fullnav_wake_folderfollow_swipe_test`

SHA-256:

```text
c4dc1fe8b3601505dcbf243f2f4dda5f0c5dc0a959008e512e7d7d4927d12e62
```

Status: **failed; do not use as a release candidate**.

The Now Playing gesture callback was observed with `a2=1, a3=1` for the single
swipe back to Folder View. In the `c4dc...` build the original callback ran
before the old explorer stack was destroyed and rebuilt for the current
playback path.

Observed on hardware:

```text
Now Playing -> swipe back
-> the correct current-track folder appears briefly
-> the UI falls back to the Music root
-> the player hangs
```

The brief correct view is a useful positive result: current-track path lookup
works, and the stock path builder can construct the desired Folder View. The
failure is therefore most likely in stack/callback ordering rather than path
resolution.

## Failed rebuild-before-callback candidate

Artifact:
`hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_fullnav_wake_folderfollow_rebuild_before_callback_test`

SHA-256:

```text
5faa8c07da3ffaeba0ac1480ae0694319473112862b3b111bd9f4920d4c06eda
```

Base: the hardware-validated `c825a72e...` sorting + full-navigation + wake
refresh binary. Status: **failed on hardware; discard**.

For the observed `a2=1, a3=1` Now Playing exit gesture, the wrapper now does:

```text
0x4E4B80  get the current playback path while the old stack is intact
0x4E4B20  destroy the old explorer-view stack
0x4E4640  build Folder View for the saved path
0x4E5FA0  tail-call the original transition callback last
```

Other gestures pass directly to the original callback. The original callback
arguments are restored before the tail-call, and its return value is returned
directly to the dispatcher. The final disassembly has explicit `nop` delay
slots for every inserted branch, `jal`, and `j`.

Whole-file comparison against the golden input found 139 changed bytes, all
confined to the callback pointer at file offsets `0xEADB4`/`0xEADBC` and the
unused executable code cave at `0x51FB00-0x51FBBF`. No navigation, wake-refresh,
or audio-path bytes changed.

See [folderfollow-rebuild-before-callback-test.md](folderfollow-rebuild-before-callback-test.md)
for the byte manifest, disassembly, and exact one-shot ADB commands.

Moving stack destruction/building before original `0x4E5FA0` changed the
failure mode but did not make stack replacement safe. Without user input, Now
Playing transitioned through Music and Files to Files root. Later the browser
returned to a broad All list, views shifted and overlapped, input stopped
responding normally, and the player exited or crashed before an automatic
reboot. Together with `c4dc...`, this rules out further simple order
permutations of `0x4E4B20`, `0x4E4B80`, `0x4E4640`, and `0x4E5FA0`.

## Failed preserve-stack retarget candidate

Artifact:
`hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_fullnav_wake_folderfollow_preserve_stack_retarget_test`

SHA-256:

```text
c637effab37ff202c172a3f32a75f0d7cfbf309eec13ab8c5ecd1a89de1adfcc
```

This candidate avoided `0x4E4B20` and `0x4E4640` and instead followed the stock
existing-view sequence around `0x4919E0`. Hardware still returned Folder View
to the folder where playback began rather than the current track's folder, and
physical buttons were temporarily unresponsive. Status: **failed; discard**.

See [folderfollow-preserve-stack-retarget-test.md](folderfollow-preserve-stack-retarget-test.md).

## Latest diagnostic: dispatcher FD9 telemetry

Artifact:
`hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_fullnav_wake_folderfollow_dispatch_fd9_diag_test`

SHA-256:

```text
6c274509946c57a642a5ae7f7a42910e6bc8abe28fba8155c973bb6a56c08912
```

Base: hardware-validated golden `c825a72e...`. The diagnostic does not destroy,
rebuild, or retarget explorer views. It records state for `a2=1,a3=1`, invokes
original `0x4E5FA0`, records the immediate post-callback state, and appends one
fixed binary record through inherited FD 9.

The controlled hardware test started in
`Roots In Russia. Русский реггей 2 (2000)`, advanced with physical Next until
`Slayer - Evil Has No Boundaries` was current, and returned to Folder View.
The old Roots folder remained visible, its old track was no longer highlighted,
and the volume wheel still responded normally. This reproduced the stale-folder
bug without UI corruption.

The three-record log has SHA-256:

```text
a76aefceaed2a8100afc066261755032a2137ef71d5ca4f7e125a0ce0d408dc2
```

All three records have stage bits `0xF7`. `0x4E4B80` returned `-1` and an empty
path before the callback. Player context, explorer pointer, current-view
pointer, explorer state, list head/tail, and the last matching Folder View were
stable across all records and unchanged immediately across original
`0x4E5FA0`; the original callback returned zero. The matching view path was the
old Roots folder and the explorer contained two matching views.

Therefore the target callback has no usable playback path before original
`0x4E5FA0`, and that callback does not synchronously retarget the Folder View.
The navigation effect is deferred or owned elsewhere. Static review also shows
that `0x4E4B80` performs internal synchronization/finalization and should not be
treated as a pure observational getter.

See [folderfollow-dispatch-fd9-diag.md](folderfollow-dispatch-fd9-diag.md) for
the byte scope, record format, corrected physical-device method, and decoded
result.

## Remaining work

1. Identify the source fields and state transitions used inside `0x4E4B80`,
   then observe those fields directly without consuming transition state.
2. Identify the owner of the deferred Folder View activation after
   `0x4E5FA0`; do not try more stack rebuild/retarget permutations first.
3. Add a byte-level patch manifest for the confirmed full-navigation and wake
   fixes.
4. Remove `/etc/init.d/S99adb` after device testing is complete.
