# Project status

Last reconstructed from the development log and local artifacts: 2026-09-02.

## Target

- Device: HiBy RS2
- Firmware: 1.4
- Player executable: MIPS32r2 ELF
- Original 1.4 `hiby_player` size: 7,133,528 bytes
- Original 1.4 SHA-256: `0fedb30f91937eafb5baaf3c75422cdbde04a62fe8bac8eca3c7a88bb761da0e`

Firmware 1.3 was used during the initial sorting work. All subsequent reverse
engineering and hardware validation moved to firmware 1.4.

## Confirmed milestones

### 1. Sorting fix

Artifact used during testing: `hiby_player_1.4_sortfix`

SHA-256:

```text
91d9e4a5d041512d26724953efbb3903f47c10b1c7a7e970bf160770254a7b8a
```

The original executable contains 14 occurrences of `COLLATE pinyin` and 18 of
`collate pinyin`. Replacing those 32 clauses with spaces changes 416 bytes,
does not change the ELF size, and restores the expected mixed-script folder
ordering.

### 2. Full folder traversal

Artifact used during testing: `hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_prev_lastchild_test`

SHA-256:

```text
d2849a8c45ce378d3ad2b2b7cf163e6fcb22d5b1670b5c5e528557945519905c
```

Confirmed behavior:

```text
Next/autoplay: 01_Flat -> Album1 -> Album2 -> 03_Flat
Previous:      03_Flat -> Album2 -> Album1 -> 01_Flat
```

The underlying defects were a comparison of local SQLite `rowid` values from
different parent lists, disabled recursive descent in the reverse direction,
and selection of the first rather than last child when entering a subtree in
reverse.

### 3. Wake refresh

Artifact used during testing:
`hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_fullnav_bkl3_force_refresh_test`

SHA-256:

```text
c825a72e1078999f74822846d35c99971f9a660addd5f12d42d50a75f0b9b80e
```

Confirmed scenario:

```text
Track A playing
-> screen off
-> automatic transition to Track B
-> Pause while the screen is off
-> screen on
-> Track B, its current time, and its progress bar are immediately displayed
```

Runtime diagnostics established that `BKL_5` is the screen-off path and
`BKL_3` is the screen-on path on this device. The successful patch performs a
metadata refresh and calls the stock progress refresh with `force=1` from the
actual `BKL_3` path.

## Active experiment: follow the current track folder

Latest artifact:
`hiby_player_1.4_sortfix_fullnav_wake_folderfollow_swipe_test`

SHA-256:

```text
c4dc1fe8b3601505dcbf243f2f4dda5f0c5dc0a959008e512e7d7d4927d12e62
```

Status: **awaiting hardware validation**.

The Now Playing gesture callback was observed with `a2=1, a3=1` for the single
swipe back to Folder View. The current approach invokes the original callback,
destroys the old explorer stack, retrieves the current playback path, and asks
the stock Folder View builder to rebuild the path. This is intended to avoid
the stacked explorer views produced by the previous screen-on experiment.

## Remaining work

1. Validate the swipe-triggered folder-follow build and immediately revert to
   the wake-refresh build if explorer views overlap or navigation regresses.
2. Convert the binary edits into a reproducible patcher with strict input hash
   checks; do not distribute patched proprietary binaries.
3. Add a byte-level patch manifest for the confirmed full-navigation and wake
   fixes.
4. Remove `/etc/init.d/S99adb` after device testing is complete.
